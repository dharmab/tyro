#Tyro

Tyro is a Java web application project template targeted at intermediate Java programmers. The intended goal is to be a stepping stone from basic Java development to Java EE web application development, allowing new programmers to write Java web apps without having to jump through all the hurdles of configuring a web server, database, etc.

Currently, Tyro is in the bootstrap process. In the future, I will write tutorials and sample apps.
